# The groupName avoids naming conflicts on the Kubernetes API, it should be set by the
# author of the webhook a unique domain that the author owns. For
# example: some-provider-webhook.mycompany.tld , or
# some-provider-webhook.mypersonalsite.tld if your webhook is a personal open-source
# project.
# Once set to a unique domain name by the webhook author, it does not need to be further
# adjusted by the users of a webhook chart!
# The name will need to be referenced in each Issuer's `webhook` stanza to
# inform cert-manager of where to send ChallengePayload resources in order to
# solve the DNS01 challenge.
